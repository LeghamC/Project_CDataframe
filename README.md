L1-S2 C project : CDataframe   
Link to repository: https://github.com/LeghamC/Project_CDataframe

Project Idea:  
For this CDataFrame project, we aim to develop a framework akin to a spreadsheet, similar to those found in programs like LibreOffice Calc or MS Excel. Our goal is to empower users to directly organize their data using operations that will be provided by our program.

Furthermore, our CDataFrame will be designed to handle various data types beyond just integers, therefore including floats, strings, and even structured types that will add versatility, enabling the manipulation of diverse datasets.

Lastly, our CDataFrame will operate as a double-linked list rather than a simple array of columns, enhancing its resemblance to a genuine spreadsheet program whilst
allowing for a more efficient control of the computer's memory.
